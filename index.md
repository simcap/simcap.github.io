Simon_Caplette -- Software Engineer (_Currently in Paris_)
========================================================

## SUMMARY

Passionate, pragmatic and efficient software developer. Experienced test driven practitioner and accustomed pair programmer.

10 years of software experience with a strong Extreme Programming background through my work in the City in London

I have held positions such as: _Backend Scalability Engineer, Ruby Platform Engineer, Lead Rails Developer, Senior Agile Java Developer, Scrum Master, XP Coach, TDD & Refactoring Trainer_.

Scaling platforms, writing applications, harnessing data & developing tools with a direct impact makes me happy!

## VALUES AT WORK

Some core values I favor when developing software in teams.

* `To go fast go clean` - Tackle technical debt during the development phase with clean code, test driven and continuous refactoring techniques.

* `Simplicity & pragmatism` - Because it is so easy to add complexity and extremely costly to remove it.

* `Egoless programming` - Because within a team everybody should be able to challenge anybody's code.
