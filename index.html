    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>For 20 years, I have been collaboratively building, securing, and ethically attacking large software platforms 
across various team dynamics, industries and cities including Sydney, London, New York, and Paris.</p>
    <p>Areas I specialized in:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Oversee, evaluate and challenge</b> security of: application, platform, Kubernetes, clouds</li>
<li><b>Define and lead</b> overall threat modelling, security choices, postures and risk frameworks</li>
<li><b>Design, build and deploy</b> reliable and scalable backend, APIs</li>
<li><b>Lead</b> engineering teams on technically advanced projects</li>
<li><b>Teach</b> professional Go and its ecosystem via real-life content workshops</li>
</ul>
<p>Various sectors I worked in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finance, Social Networking, Internet Service Provider, Insurance, In-car detection system</li>
        <li>Security, P2P streaming platform, Sports & Gaming, NFT, Ethereum</li>    
    </ul>
    <p>I have been using and deploying <a href="https://go.dev/" target="_blank">Go</a> in production for the last 10 years, as well as <a href="https://www.rekon.io/workshops" target="_blank">teaching</a> the language and its ecosystem.</p>

    <p>
        I have also managed and scaled engineering teams, applying Extreme Programming
        techniques. I strive for software quality and favor pragmatic and collective approaches.
        In my daily job, I like to build reliable software products collectively, scale, pentest
        platforms, provide multi-cloud secured infrastructure, find flaws in applications
        and components, write great and secure APIs as well as
        harnessing data and creating tools that have an impact!
