    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>

        Durign that time, I have held various positions: 
        <ul>
            <li>Technical Lead, Principal Engineer, Platform Engineer, Security Engineer</li>
            <li>DevOps Engineer, Backend & Scalability Engineer</li>

    <p>
        I also manage and scale engineering teams, applying Extreme Programming
        techniques for a long time now. I strive for software quality and favor
        pragmatic and collective approaches to build software.
        In my daily job, I like to build reliable software products collectively, scale
        platforms, provide multi-cloud secured infrastructure, find flaws in applications
        and components, write secure backend and scalable API (using Go) as well as
        harnessing data and developing tools that have an impact!
